		Computer science is a discipline concerned with the analysis, design,
		implementation, maintenance, and evolution of computer-based systems
		used in almost all walks of life. Computer science is at the center of
		the <em>information revolution</em> in the 21st century.<b>
			Advanced computation tools and techniques</b> are revolutionizing and
		transforming the way we work, play, communicate, collaborate, and
		conduct business. In addition, computational approaches are integral
		to several scientific and engineering fields such as computational
		sciences, bioinformatics, and health informatics, to name a few.
	</p>

	<p class="para_Class">
		Computer scientists must be well-grounded not only in the theory of
		computing, but also in its application to diverse areas. Computer
		scientists must be capable of working closely with members of other
		professions associated with computing. Students who pursue this
		discipline will learn about <em>programming languages, data
			structures, algorithms, operating systems, artificial intelligence,
			robotics, data mining, computer networking, cyber-security, databases
			and software engineering.</em>
